Grant Workshop

(1) Formulate the humanities question(s) guiding the project.

What are some common themes of networks formed by artists? Record labels?  
What are some common themes across decades of rap and R&B music? 

(2) Provide a one-paragraph abstract written for a non specialist audience, clearly explaining the projectâ€™s principal activities and its expected results.

Music and the history of specifically hip hop has been shape and altered by many societal and cultural factors. Tracing the progression and change of this genre can uncover so much about the cultural and even political atmosphere at the time. Hip Hop music has always been used as an outlet for the African American community.  This grant would help categorize the themes during peak periods of Hip Hop music while also looking at the connections between artists who collaborated together to see if there is a connection between artists and the themes they addressed in their music. 
Networking and topic modeling will be the most used methods of measuring this. Networking will be used to visualize the connections between artists that collaborate with one another and also to see the involvement of record labels and specifically what artists they work with. Topic modeling is a method that will be used to take a closer look at the common themes of songs across decades specifically 1990-2018. 
This project will encompass aspects of the humanities like history, linguistics, etc but also the digitized aspect is all of the songs and artists  available online. This project is an interesting way to understand history and discover different perspectives of history.
